# Youtube-MP3-MP4-Downloader
A script that I made when I got really bored that downloads a YouTube video as .mp4 or .mp3 in the desired folder in Python

## Setup:
You need to install pytube and moviepy for that, and you need to write
### pip install pytube
### pip install moviepy

then run the youtube_downloader.py file and follow the instructions it is basic really.

### Will do If I am bored again:
#### The script will open a file explorer instead of asking for a written path. [DONE]
#### It will have video quality options for .mp4 files. [DONE]
##### yes i got bored again
